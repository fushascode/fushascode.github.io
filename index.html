<h1>Joe's Placement Documentation</h1>
  <h2>17/10/2022</h2>
  
  <p> Monday - Made changes to school website (Sports section / Contact Section) Updated the current lists
  to reflect current students who hold the relevant positions. I've also removed, cleaned and installed projectors in 2 rooms. Configured wifi in
  Maraki to allow students to join wifi after consistent error that prevented this.</p>
  
  <p> These tasks allowed me to broaden my understanding on HTML and real world implemenation, troubleshooting a device for reasons it was overheating and
    the installtion process required to dis-assemble and reconfigure projectors.</p>
